# skill-music-demo
A demo of music on the Mark II

If you specifiy an artist and song you should get 
the song. If you just specifiy an artist, usually
you get a playlist which takes a bit to download 
and convert (an hour and a half Joe Cocker playlist
takes about a minute to download). 

Skill initiates download thread even if it is not
selected to play the media for performance.
